<p>Global meltdown toward the weak economy (by <cite>Ankit verma </cite> )</p>
Geopolitics never be the same as before. 
The global shift toward the weaker country shows how countries like usa , china , russia , ind the west tild their interest towards the weak nations . it is assumes that these all country founds lots of reserves int the city of barmuda , latvania , ethopia , and many more african nation <div class="br">this happens because of a new discovery named lailalothphosis . A new element much more powerful than the uranium . this discovery happens when Indian scientist <strong><em>Shivansh gupta </em></strong> publish there research under Indian institute of space and science Trivantpuram . 
with the collabation of Indian space research organization and DRDO. <br>
in this study when he was roaming arount the euthopia unibersuty he founts=ds and misterious stone as a chemistry expert he wants to make some study on rock and came back to india for the better research facilities .
<br>
under his own specific research he founds that the new element have no radiactive particle but still have potential to make almost 90% of global supply electricity with only 2 gm of lailalothphosis. <br> he publish his reserch in many journals . then indian government came into exitence tio take over the research and with the joint collbaration of ISRO and Drdo India buy all mine fields of smaller nation who have lailalothphosis .
<br> now india holds 99% deposits of lailalothphosis in the world .
thats why big ecomomy looks up to weaker country so they can broke thei treaty with india and they can also enjoy the profit of the peice by making peice of thise country .
<br> because of this deals the tension between india nad the west arise . 
it may leads to world war .
